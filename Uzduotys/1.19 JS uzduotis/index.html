    <p>Space is the vast, three-dimensional expanse that contains all matter and energy in the universe. The <span>big bang theory</span> is the most widely accepted explanation for the origin of the universe.</p>
    <p>The <span>Sun</span> is a medium-sized star located at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect spherical ball of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.</p>
    <p>Earth is the <span>third planet</span> from the Sun and the only known planet to support life. The Earth's atmosphere protects life on Earth by absorbing ultraviolet solar radiation, warming the surface through heat retention, and reducing temperature extremes between day and night.</p>
    <p>The <span>Moon</span> is Earth's only natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest satellite in the Solar System and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits.</p>
    <p>Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore outer space. The first human-made object to reach space was the <span>V-2 rocket</span> in 1942, and the first satellite, <span>Sputnik 1</span>, was launched in 1957. <span>NASA</span>, the <span>Soviet space program</span>, and <span>ESA</span> are the main space exploration agencies today.</p>
